                     We had started working on this project on 10 April 2021. The last week we had completed till 
                     the  the basic electronic circuit setup. Previously we had tested our electric circuit using a basic Blynk
                     application. The circuit was found to be working as intended. Sir had insisted that we develop the application in MIT App Inventor .

              1. Replacing ESP 32 with ESP 8266  
            </h3>
            <p>The initial plan was to implement using ESP 32 but we were met with some roadblocks . ESP 32 has bluetooth but its ranges only  10m radius. Since 
                we needed our app to function within a wider range we had to opt for wifi based over a bluetooth for connection.
                We also decided to switch to ESP8266 beacuse we felt it would be easier to do what we were planning with this microcontroller.

                   After working with two to three designs , we finialized with the above design model.
                   The design was chosen beacuse it very aesthetic , ergonomic and easy to use . The safety features were also mentioned while designing.

                   The front end  was developed in MIT APP inventor. The application had a simple UI , with a button that enbale to On
                   / Off the alarm system . The application will be connected to the ESP8266 via Wifi connection.
