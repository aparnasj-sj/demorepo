                ESP 32
            </h3>
            <p>ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. The ESP32 series employs a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor in both dual-core and single-core variations and includes built-in antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power-management modules. ESP32 is created and developed by Espressif Systems, 
                a Shanghai-based Chinese company, and is manufactured by TSMC using their 40 nm process.[2] It is a successor to the ESP8266 microcontroller.</p>

                    The first task was to draw the circuit according to the specifications.The motor is programmed using ESP32.ESP32 is powered by regulated 
                    voltage of 3.3 V.The transistor used in 2N2222 . The first draft of the circuit had some mistakes .Afterwards the circuit was modified by Amith sir.
                    The final version of ciruit diagram is as shown above.

                <p class="width75">
                    The next task was to assemble the circuit on  PCB according to the circuit diagram .A battery of 7.4 Voltage ws connected to regulator 
                     to obtain 3.3 V and 5.1 V .The 5.1 V to diode IN007 ans 3.3 V to the ESP32 .The motor was programmed by ESP 32 and using transistor.

                <p class="width75">
                    The third task was to program the ESP32 .The code was written on arduino IDE and uploaded to the microcontroller . 
                    he DC motor requires a big jump in current to move, so the motors should be powered using an external power source from the ESP32.
