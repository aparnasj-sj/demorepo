                ESP 32
            </h3>
            <p>ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. The ESP32 series employs a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor in both dual-core and single-core variations and includes built-in antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power-management modules. ESP32 is created and developed by Espressif Systems, 
                a Shanghai-based Chinese company, and is manufactured by TSMC using their 40 nm process. It is a successor to the ESP8266 microcontroller.</p>

                <p class="width75">
                    The first task was to draw the circuit according to the specifications. The motor is programmed using ESP32. ESP32 is powered by regulated 
                    voltage of 3.3V. The transistor used in 2N2222 . The first draft of the circuit had some mistakes. Afterwards the circuit was modified by Amith sir.
                    The final version of ciruit diagram is as shown above.

                <p class="width75">
                    The next task was to assemble the circuit on  PCB according to the circuit diagram . A battery of 7.4 Voltage ws connected to regulator 
                     to obtain 3.3 V and 5.1 V. The 5.1 V to diode IN007 ans 3.3 V to the ESP32 .The motor was programmed by ESP 32 and using transistor.
                     The different cricuits were done for an experimentation/study purpose.The esp32 controlllig process was initially tried with an on/off sign ,then with an LED and then with motor control and Blynk app interface

                <p class="width75">
                    The third task was to program the ESP32 .The code was written on arduino IDE and uploaded to the microcontroller . 
                    The DC motor requires a big jump in current to move, so the motor should be powered using an external power source from the ESP32.
